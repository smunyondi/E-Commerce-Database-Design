# üõçÔ∏è E-Commerce Database Design

Welcome to the **E-Commerce Database Design** project for PLP Peer to Peer **Group 196**! This repository contains the conceptual and logical design of a scalable e-commerce database system. It's a foundational component for managing online retail platforms efficiently, covering everything from product listings to variations like color, size, and attributes.

---

## üìò Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a comprehensive database schema for an e-commerce platform. The design uses **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling** principles and includes a wide range of features such as:

- Product listings and images  
- Brand and category management  
- Product variations (e.g., color, size)  
- Custom attributes (e.g., material, weight)  
- Size classifications  
- A modular structure that supports future scalability

---

## üß© Key Features

- **Normalized Tables**: Clean and structured data separation using relational tables.
- **Flexible Product Variations**: Supports color, size, and attribute combinations.
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new features like reviews, discounts, or inventory management.
- **ERD Visual Diagram**: Generated using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io), showing all entities and relationships.
